# AuraCast

A new Flutter project.

AuraCast is a weather application that makes recommendations matching the mood based on the
weather. On rainy days it might suggest cozy indoor activities like reading, mellow playlists, or hot drink
recipes, while sunny and clear weather inspires recommendations for outdoor activities such as jogging, picnics,
or energizing music.
